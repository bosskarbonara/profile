            <h2> Studio Ghibli </h2>
                <p>
                    Studio Ghibli Inc. (Japanese: 株式会社スタジオジブリ, Hepburn: Kabushiki-gaisha Sutajio Jiburi) is a Japanese animation film studio headquartered in Koganei, Tokyo.[1] The studio is best known for its animated feature films, and has also produced several short films, television commercials, and one television film. The studio's mascot and most recognizable symbol is the character Totoro, a giant cat-like spirit from the studio's 1988 film My Neighbor Totoro. Studio Ghibli's highest grossing films include Spirited Away (2001), Ponyo (2008), and Howl's Moving Castle (2004).[2] The studio was founded on June 15, 1985 by directors Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata and producer Toshio Suzuki, after the success of Topcraft's anime film Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (1984). Studio Ghibli has also collaborated with video game studios on the visual development of several video games.[3]

                    Five of Studio Ghibli's films are among the 10 highest-grossing anime films made in Japan, with Spirited Away being number two, grossing over US$380 million worldwide. Many of their works have won the Animage Anime Grand Prix award, and four have won the Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year. Five of Studio Ghibli's films have received Academy Award nominations. Spirited Away won the Golden Bear in 2002 and the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film in 2003.[4]

                    On August 3, 2014, Studio Ghibli temporarily halted production, following the retirement of Miyazaki. In February 2017, Suzuki announced that Miyazaki had come out of retirement again to direct a new feature film, How Do You Live?.
